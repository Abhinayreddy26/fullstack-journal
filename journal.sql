(4, 4, ' The Impact of New Trade Tariffs in 2025', 'Trade tariffs continue to shape the global economic landscape in 2025. Recently, several countries have imposed or increased tariffs as part of efforts to protect local industries, respond to economic pressures, or assert political leverage. The United States, for example, has raised tariffs on certain electronics and automotive parts from China, citing unfair trade practices and national security concerns.\n\nThese actions have triggered a ripple effect globally. China has responded with counter-tariffs on agricultural goods, further straining relations. Meanwhile, developing countries like Kenya are navigating these changes carefully, as global tariff policies can indirectly affect export markets and supply chains.\n\nIn East Africa, regional cooperation within the EAC (East African Community) has remained strong. However, member states are still grappling with balancing affordable imports and protecting local production. Kenyaâ€™s growing trade with the EU under the EPA agreement continues to offer opportunities, but rising global protectionism could pose risks.\n\nOverall, the shift toward more protectionist trade policies raises concerns about long-term global cooperation. For countries like Kenya, maintaining strategic trade relationships and enhancing local production capacity will be essential to weather potential disruptions in international trade.', '2025-05-03 13:12:02', '2025-05-03 13:12:02');
